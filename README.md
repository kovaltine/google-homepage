This is a fake google homepage. I used this project as practice, it was the first time I worked on a project independently rather than following step-by-step instructions. Overall I'm pleased with the knowledge I gained, however I had certain issues, like putting select items on the left side of the page in the navbar and others on the right. I did learn how to keep the footer at the bottom of the page. After a few hours of work I decided to move on.
